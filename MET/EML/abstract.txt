This weather station network includes two Cambpbell Scientific datalogger nodes with above and below ground sensors. The
primary station is situated in grasslands and equiped with standard above ground weather station equipment designed to record
wind, rain, temperature, humidity, solar radiation and leaf wetness. Below ground this primary station is equipped soil moisture
sensors of two types at four depths. Soil moisture is measured in terms of both volumetric water content of the soil and soil
water potential. A second nearby station is situated in an oak woodland habitat and is equiped with an identical set of soil
moisture sensors as well as a leaf wetness sensor above ground. Objectives include providing calibration capabilites for models
of soil moisture and drought stress, providing data for US Geologic Survey data releases and documenting a baseline of abiotic
conditions at Pepperwood's Sentinel Site for use in ecological research.
