This automatic weather station, which is run via a CRBasic program, includes above ground sensors for solar radiation, temperature and humidity, rainfall, windspeed, wind direction, 
two-dimensional wind speed and direction, leaf wetness and barometric pressure. Specific instruments used include a CR3000 datalogger, solar radiation (LI200S), temperature and humidity 
(HMP-45C), rainfall (TE-525), windspeed (014A), wind direction (024A), two-dimensional wind speed and direction (Wind Sonic Ultrsonic Wind Sensor 1405-PK?), wetness (Decagon LWS) 
and barometric pressure (PTB120/ CS106).Data freqency is at 15-minute intervals, and rainfall data is collected additionally in an a event based manner, driven by every hundreth of an 
inch of precipitation. All above ground sensors are co-located with the below ground sensors at the Bechtel House weather station, . Below ground soil Moisture is quantified in terms 
of soil water content by time delay reflectometer (CS615) and soil waterpotential by heat dissapation probes (CS229L) each at four different depths, which are 6, 12, 22, and 36 inches 
below the soil surface.
