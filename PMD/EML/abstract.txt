We utilized mini-disk infiltrometers with 2.5 centimeter radius steel disks to measure soil water infiltration before and after a major wildfire. Soil water infiltration was measured according to the decagon mini disk user manual specifications, and guidance provided by the USGS in 2018. Pre-fire mini disk observations were collected at Pepperwood between October of 2015 and April of 2016, using a layer of diatomaceous earth between the disk and ground surface to improve contact. We reoccupied sites with baseline data in 2018, at point locations estimated to be within 1 meter of the original unmarked locations established in 2015-2016. Starting in February of 2018, we marked sites with flagging and four nails arranged  in a 5 inch square, at the center of which we placed mini disk infiltrometers and observed infiltration volume every 30 seconds to one minute, making a minimum of 30 observations and allowing a minimum of 10mL of water to infiltrate the soil. 

Each site was measured once during the 7-month pre-fire period and the number of observations ranged from 6 up to 12 at each point, or between 28 and 60 observations per transect.
In 2015 – 2016 soil carbon and soil bulk density were taken at all grassland transect sites, following methodologies were based upon the soil sampling methods described in the Point Blue Rangeland Monitoring Networks Handbook of Field Methods. In 2018 soil samples were collected for grain size analysis within USGS labs. This project is being run in conjunctions with a collaborative project between the USGS and Sonoma County Water Agency, but currently this dataset contains observations collected at Pepperwood by Pepperwood staff and volunteers.
