Equipment for measuring infiltration are 2.5 centimeter radius mini disk infiltrometers with steel disks.
Sites were falgged and precise location marked in 2018 with four nails in a 5 inch square at the center of which measurements were taken from 2018 on.

Pre-fire mini disk observations were collected at Pepperwood between October of 2015 and April of 2016. 
This baseline data was taken at point locations estimated to be within 1 meter of the marked locations established in 2018.
Each site was measured once during the 7-month pre-fire period, and between 28 and 60 observations were taken per transect, or from less than 6 up to 12 observations at each point.
Pre-fire soil water infiltration was measured according to user decagon mini disk manual specifications, with the use of diatamaceous earth at the point of contact.
Additionally soil carbon and soil bulk density were taken before the fire at all grassland transect sites, 
following methodologies were based upon the soil sampling methods described in the Point Blue Rangeland Monitoring Networks Handbook of Field Methods.
