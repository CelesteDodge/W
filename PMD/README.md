# PMD
PMD is for Pepperwood Mini Disk - a study of soil water infiltration before and after the destructive North Bay Fires of 2017.

Pepperwood serves as a Watershed Sentinel Site dedicated to tracking ecosystem health over time by systematically monitoring things like weather, soil moisture, stream flow, and the diversity and vitality of local plant and animal populations. Over 70 projects onsite are run by a combination of staff, citizen scientists, visiting scholars, and university partners. This long-term monitoring has immediate benefits for land and water managers, and will be vital to evaluating climate impacts in real time and informing best resource management practices over time.
